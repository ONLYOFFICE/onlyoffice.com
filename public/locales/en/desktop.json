  "ZanshiReview": "Compared to google - it's offline and I think Google's product is simpler, Only Office is meant to be used instead of Libre Office rather than Google. <0></0> Compared to MS Office - you can have documents in tabs, a doc in one and a spreadsheet in another all in one window. Its compatibility with MS Office formats is a lot better than Libre Office. I used it at work, we were given total freedom as to what we use. Only requirement was that we are able to work. I had no problems opening and creating files that others used MS for. Only problem I had was with fonts, but that is probably due to not having those fonts installed.",
  "Codorin1913Review": "Amazing piece of software. Using it for all the closed format docs.",

  "julianvjupiterReview": "Nice improvement on ribbon, but I would still use <1>@only_office</1>. It is shiny, very close to mso, lightweight.",
  "thomas_r8Review": "I discovered OnlyOffice a few months ago (via a post on Reddit). I installed it on my Ubuntu, because I was tired of starting a Windows VM to edit some documents. I really like these design: you can switch to any Word, Excel or Powerpoint document with tabs. The major drawback for me is that you cannot open multiple windows, which is nice to have if you would like you compare multiple documents. The formatting of original Microsoft Office documents is well displayed in OnlyOffice, you can even write Microsoft proprietary fonts.<0></0> TL;DR : OnlyOffice is nice to quickly edit Microsoft Word documents.",
